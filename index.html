      <p>Greece is a country in Southeast Europe that is made up of a chain of islands throughout the Aegean, Ionian and Mediterranean seas. Most of the population lives in and around the capital, Athens, and the rest of the population is sprawled around the islands and other urban areas. The country is conventionally known as "Hellenic Republic" and was emancipated from the Ottoman Empire in the mid 1800s.</p>

        <p>Since then, Greece was occupied by both Italy and Germany in World War II, and in the 60s the country was seized by a group of military officers, leading to a military dictatorship that lasted well into the 1970s. In 1981, Greece joined the EU, and joined the Economic and Monetary Union in 2001, becoming their 12th member.</p>

        <p>The country entered three bailout agreements, having suffered a severe economic crisis due to "chronic overspending and structural rigidities." The first two bailout agreements were with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF; and the third was with the European Stability Mechanism. Greece exited their third bailout in August 2018.
