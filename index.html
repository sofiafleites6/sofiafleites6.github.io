        <h2> Production Experience</h2>
          <p>Her senior year, Sofia was promoted to executive producer of the
          spanish show on UMTV. As an executive producer she was able to create a new
        show from scratch which included, writing, casting, and directing every episode
      throughout the season. Though she loved being on camera, producing was a new challenge
    for her and she quickly grew to love it more than on-camera work. </p>
