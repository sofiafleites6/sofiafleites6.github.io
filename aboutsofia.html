      <h2>About Sofia</h2>

      <img src="images/aboutsofiaphoto.JPG" alt= "Sofia graduation headshot">

      <p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. I found my passion to enter the media industry from my father who owned a business that sold professional broadcast television equipment to stations both locally and internationally.</p>

        <p>Being exposed to this field from a very young age, I made the decision to take T.V. Production at my high school. I loved the classÂ immediately and from then on was hooked on the media industry. </p>

        <p>Today, I am a student at the University of Miami with a double major in Broadcast Journalism and English Literature and a minor in Marketing. I continue to be passionate about photography, editing and the media arts as I pursue a career in the industry.</p>
