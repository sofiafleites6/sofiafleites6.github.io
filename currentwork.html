      <h2>Sofia's Current Work</h2>
      <p>As a Senior at the University of Miami, I am approaching my fourth year of being involved in the student-run broadcast network on campus, UMTV. </p>

        <p>It is my second semester as executive producer and editor of the only spanish-speaking show on the network, UniMiami. I have acted as reporter, anchor, and crew member for UniMiami since my freshman year and find it very fulfilling that I have been able to work my way up to this leadership position. </p>

        <p>As I near graduation, I hope to continue to work in the industry, as a producer, with the dream of someday working for a station in New York. Linked is a reel with my most current work. </p>
